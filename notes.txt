Technical Problems:
    How do we communicate votes to listener?
    How do we store votes on the blockchain?
        Sparse due to districts?


Design Problems:
    Use timing to figure out who a person voted for.
        Assume large number of people vote at any given time.
    People vote on different candidates depending on location
        Store each vote individually
            Submit as one vote, check key, split and post to blockchain
        Just need simple tally
